Repository for yaq core python packages:
- yaqc-python
- yaqd-core-python
- yaqd-fakes

Each of these projects is distributed as a separate package.

These core packages are kept in one repository primarily such that, when needed, changes can be made simulatiously to multiple packages whithout breaking tests.
